# Problem Understanding

Predicting outcomes from real-world data is a core responsibility of an AI/ML engineer. In agriculture, crop yield prediction is an important problem as it affects food security, economic planning, and resource management. Crop yield depends on multiple factors such as rainfall, temperature, pesticide usage, crop type, and location, making it a suitable real-world machine learning problem.

In this project, a publicly available crop yield dataset is used, containing historical data on country, crop type, year, rainfall, pesticide usage, and average temperature. The goal is to build a machine learning model that can predict crop yield (hg/ha) based on these factors.

The project focuses not only on prediction accuracy but also on proper data preprocessing, model selection, and result interpretation. Multiple models are evaluated, and the final model is chosen based on performance metrics and generalization ability, with feature importance and error analysis used to explain the results.
